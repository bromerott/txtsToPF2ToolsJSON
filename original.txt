	The cockatrice enters a primal rage. It gains a +6 morale bonus to damage rolls, but takes a -2 penalty to AC.
	Calcification
	(incapacitation, primal, transmutation) A peck from a cockatrice hardens the flesh of the creature struck. The target must succeed at a DC 24 Fortitude save or become slowed 1 (or slowed 2 on a critical failure). Further failed saves against calcification increase the slowed condition. Once a creature’s actions are reduced to 0 by calcification, that creature becomes petrified.


Every 24 hours after it was petrified, the victim can attempt a DC 24 Fortitude save to recover. On a success, it becomes flesh again, but is slowed 1 for the next 24 hours. On a critical success, the creature recovers and isn’t slowed. On a failure, the creature remains petrified, but can try again in 24 hours. On a critical failure, the petrification is permanent, and the creature can’t attempt any more saves.

Regardless of the save, while within the aura, creatures take a –2 circumstance penalty to saves against diseases.
