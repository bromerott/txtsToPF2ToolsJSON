	Melee
	(A)
	vile touch +20 [+15/+10] (finesse), Damage 8d6 negative plus spectral corruption
	Spectral Corruption
	(curse, divine, enchantment, incapacitation, mental) When the specter damages a living creature with its vile touch Strike, the specter gains 5 temporary Hit Points and the target creature must attempt a DC 27 Will save to avoid becoming corrupted.
* Critical Success The creature is unaffected and is temporarily immune to spectral corruption for 1 minute.
* Success The creature is stupefied 2 for 1 hour.
* Failure The creature succumbs to the corruption and becomes a spectral thrall. The creature is controlled by the specter, obeying the specter's telepathic or spoken orders, though a spectral thrall does not obey obviously self-destructive orders. It can attempt a new Will save at the end of each of its turns; on a success, it is no longer controlled by the specter but becomes stupefied 2 for 1 hour.
* Critical Failure As failure, but the creature remains a thrall to the specter until the curse is removed or until the specter succumbs to pain starvation; it can't attempt new Will saves to recover on its own.
