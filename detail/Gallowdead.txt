Effect The gallowdead makes one spike chain Strike. On a success, the strike deals an extra 8d10 negative damage (basic Fortitude save DC 38). On a failure, the strike does not count towards the gallowdead’s multiple attack penalty.

	A gallowdead can expertly maneuver a grabbed creature with its spiked chain. It does not need to spend an action to extend the duration for creatures it already has grabbed.
