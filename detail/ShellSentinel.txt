	Shell Storm
	(AA) 
	The Sentinel makes a talon attack against all creatures within reach. Its multiple attack penalty increases only after all the attacks.
	Fragile Frame
	Whenever a shell sentinel is dealt a critical hit from a bludgeoning weapon or rolls a critical failure on a Reflex save, it must succeed at a DC 27 Fortitude save to resist being forced to discorporate. For 2 rounds, a shell sentinel gains weakness 10 to bludgeoning damage.
	Ink Cloud
	(AA) 
	Frequency once per minute
The Sentinel exudes a dark cloud of ink as long as its underwater, spreading as a 10 ft. aura. Creatures in the cloud other than the sentinel are blinded while in the area,
