	Hunt Prey
	(A)
	(concentrate) The strix archer designates a single creature they can see and hear, or one they're Tracking, as their prey. 
	Quick Like the Wind
	(A)
	Frequency once per minute
Effect The strix archer strides twice.
	Distracting Shot
	The sheer power of a strix archer’s shots hinder a defender’s chances to block, and unbalance them greatly. If they critically hit their hunted prey with a ranged weapon, or hit it at least twice on the same turn with a ranged weapon, the target is flat-footed until the start of the strix’s next turn.
	Precision Edge
	The first time the strix archer hits their hunted prey in a round, they deal an additional 1d8 precision damage.
