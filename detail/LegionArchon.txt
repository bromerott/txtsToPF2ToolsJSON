	If disarmed or thrown, the flame of justice vanishes after landing or dealing damage and reappears in the legion archonâ€™s hands again instantly. On a critical hit, the fire damage from the flame of justice deals maximum damage (6 on the d6) before being doubled for the critical hit, and the target takes 1d10 persistent fire damage.
