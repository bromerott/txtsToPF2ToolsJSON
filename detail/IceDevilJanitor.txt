	Janitor of Cocytus
	(A)
	An ice devil’s logical mind devises genius tactics from its perfect memory, and when those genius tactics are applied to cleaning, they can be lethal. The ice devil can telepathically move items with his mind, functioning as a 4th-level Telekinetic Assault (DC 35).
	Divine Innate Spells
	DC 35; 7th cone of cold, forcecage; 6th illusory scene, feeblemind; 5th dimension door, wall of ice (x3); 4th dimension door (at will); Cantrips (7th) ray of frost; Constant (4th) fly Rituals DC 33; 1st infernal pact


	Slowing Frost
	The ice devil channels the extreme cold of its body through its appendages and weapons. A creature hit by an ice devil’s weapon or unarmed attack in melee must attempt a DC 34 Fortitude save or be slowed 1 for 1d4 rounds. A weapon used by an ice devil gains the effects of a frost rune while the gelugon holds it, and the ice devil can throw any such weapon with a 20-foot range increment, trailing motes of frost.
