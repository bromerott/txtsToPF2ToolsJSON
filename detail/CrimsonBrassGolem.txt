	(A)
	The crimson brass golem exhumes a choking incendiary cloud in a 15-foot cone. Creatures in the area take 4d8+9 fire damage (DC 33 basic Reflex save).
	Shred Armor
	A crimson brass golem's body is so sharp that it tears through armor like a knife through butter. Whenever the golem scores a critical hit with a fist Strike against a creature wearing non-adamantine armor, the creature's armor becomes broken.
