	The devilfish makes a fangs Strike against a creature it is grabbing. If the attack hits, the creature is knocked prone; if the creature is wearing armor with hardness 10 or lower, the armor is broken. If this Strike breaks a creature's armor or damages a creature who is unarmored or wearing broken armor, the creature also takes 2d6 persistent bleed damage. This Strike doesn't further damage armor that's already broken.
