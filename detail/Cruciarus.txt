	Tortured Gaze
	(A)
	(visual) The cruciarus can channel the excruciating pain it felt as it died of doghousing against a target within 30 feet of it. The target must make a basic DC 31 Fortitude save against 6d4 points of mental damage. On a failure, the target is also fatigued.
	Pain Touch
	A cruciarus’ attacks cause wracking, agonizing pains to tear through a victim’s body. It ignores all kinds of resistances, but does not harm undead. Creatures affected by pain touch make a DC 31 Fortitude save or become stunned 1 from the pain.


The stunned condition from a cruciarus can stack with itself or other cruciaruses’.
