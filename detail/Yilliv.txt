	Swiftness

	Steal Memories
	Yilliv’s ribbon lashes steal the memories from their targets and magically writes them down in Soul Tomes linked to those creatures. Each strike makes the target stupefied 1. This condition can stack with itself up to a maximum of stupefied 10. A creature can read from its own soul tome in order to restore the stolen memories. Every 10 minutes spent in study lessens the stupefied condition by 1.
