	Shadow Aura A shadow golem constantly exudes an aura of eerie shadowy illumination, causing the area surrounding it to a distance of 60 feet to function as if illuminated by dim light, regardless of the ambient lighting (or lack thereof). As long as a shadow golem is in dim light (such as that granted by its own aura), it gains a +2 status bonus to its AC and has a fly speed of 20 ft. 


Additionally, whenever a character attempts to cast a spell with the light trait in the aura, the aura attempts to automatically counteract it. (spell level 7th, counteract modifier +28).

	Vulnerable to Light Casting a spell with the light descriptor on a Shadow Golem automatically suppresses its aura for 1 minute.
	Vulnerable to Searing Light Casting a Searing Light spell on a Shadow Golem deals no damage to it, but makes it slowed 1 for 1 minute. (no save)
