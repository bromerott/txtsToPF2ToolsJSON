	(A)
	Frequency once per round. Effect The barbazu makes a beard Strike. This Strike ignores their multiple attack penalty and doesn’t count toward that penalty.
	Divine Innate Spells DC 21; 5th dimension door; 4th dimension door (at will)

	Avernal Fever (disease) Saving Throw DC 25 Fortitude; Stage 1 carrier with no ill effect (1 day); Stage 2 enfeebled 1 (1 day); Stage 3 enfeebled 2 (1 day)
	Infernal Wound
	The barbazu’s glaive Strikes also deal 1d6 persistent bleed damage that resists attempts to heal it. The flat check to stop the bleeding starts at DC 20. The DC is reduced to 15 only if the bleeding creature or an ally successfully assists with the recovery. The DC to Administer First Aid to a creature with an infernal wound is increased by 5. A spellcaster or item attempting to use healing magic on a creature suffering from an infernal wound must succeed at a DC 25 counteract check or the magic fails to heal the creature.
	Reposition
	(R)
	Trigger The barbazu hits a creature with a glaive Strike. Effect The barbazu moves the creature 5 feet in any direction. The destination square must be within reach of his glaive. This movement doesn’t trigger reactions.
