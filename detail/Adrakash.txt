	Melee
	(A)
	spectral jaws +35 [+30/+35] (reach 20 feet), Damage 8d8+8 negative plus drain life
	Melee
	(A)
	spectral claw +35 [+31/+27] (agile, reach 15 feet), Damage 8d6+8 negative plus divine dispelling and drain life
	Breath Weapon
	(AA)
	 (divine, necromancy, negative) Adrakash unleashes a burst of negative energy that deals 20d6 negative damage to all creatures in a 60-foot cone (DC 40 basic Reflex save). It can’t use Breath Weapon again for 1d4 rounds.
	Divine Dispelling
	(abjuration, divine) Adrakash’s claws rend divine magic. Whenever he hits a creature with one of its spectral claws, Adrakash can attempt a Religion check to counteract an ongoing divine spell effect (of spell level 8th or lower) on the creature.
	Draconic Frenzy
	(A)
	Adrakash makes two claw Strikes and one jaws Strike in any order.
	Phase Lurch
	(A)
	(divine, move) Requirements Adrakash is in ectoplasmic form; Effect As the Stride action, but Adrakash can pass through walls or material obstacles as though he were incorporeal. He must begin and end its movement outside of any physical obstacles, and passing through solid material is difficult terrain.
	Ectoplasmic Form
	(A)
	(divine, necromancy) Adrakash can push through the ectoplasmic veil to temporarily assume a physical form made of ectoplasm. Adrakash loses the incorporeal trait for 1d4 rounds, though it can return to its incorporeal form as a free action before then. Once this ability ends, Adrakash can’t use this ability again for 1d4 rounds. While in ectoplasmic form, Adrakash’s AC increases to 43 and it gains 100 temporary Hit Points. He loses his immunity to non-magical attacks and precision damage, as well as its resistance to all damage. His claw and jaws Strikes deal slashing and piercing damage, respectively, instead of negative damage.
	Divine Innate Spells
	DC 37, attack +35; 8th charm (undead targets only); 7th divine wrath (x3), finger of death; 6th vampiric exsanguination; 4th charm (x3; undead targets only), darkness; 3rd bind undead (at will)
	Drain Life
	(divine, necromancy) When Adrakash deals damage to a living creature with a spectral jaws or spectral claw Strike, Adrakash gains 18 temporary Hit Points, and the creature must succeed at a DC 40 Fortitude save or become drained 2. Further damage dealt by Adrakash’s spectral jaws or spectral claws Strikes increases the value of the drained condition by 2 on a failed save, to a maximum of drained 8.
