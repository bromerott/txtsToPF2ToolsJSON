	Reactive Slime (R) Trigger A creature within Magvhune’s reach successfully hits him with a Strike; Effect Mangvhune excretes a gout of acidic, bloodlike slime against the attacker and its weapon. The attacker must attempt a DC 38 Reflex save.

	A Cut To the Spine, To Prepare You
	(AA)
	(incapacitation) Mangvhune swings his sword, perfectly aiming at the target’s spinal cord at the base of the neck. Mangvhune makes a melee Strike. This counts as two attacks when calculating his multiple attack penalty. If this Strike hits the creature struck is frightened 4 and paralyzed while frightened (paralyzed until healed on a Critical Strike).
	And A Cut To The Throat, To End You!
	(AA)
	(death, incapacitation) Mangvhune makes a Strike against a creature he has paralyzed with Grievous Strike. If he hits, the creature takes an additional 8d6 precision damage, with a basic DC 36 Fortitude save against the damage. On a critical failure, the target dies instantly.
