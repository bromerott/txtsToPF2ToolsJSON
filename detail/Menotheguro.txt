	Slime
	(curse, occult, virulent) Saving Throw Fortitude DC 29; Stage 1 no ill effect (1 round); Stage 2 the victim’s skin softens, inflicting drained 1 (1 round); Stage 3 the victim’s skin transforms into a clear, slimy membrane, inflicting drained 2 until the curse ends; every hour this membrane remains dry, the creature’s drained condition increases by 1 (permanent). A remove disease spell can counteract this curse, but immunity to disease offers no protection against it.
