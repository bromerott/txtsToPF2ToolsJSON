Critical Success The creature is unaffected and is temporarily immune to witchflame for 1 hour.
Success The creature appears to catch fire with sickly green flames. These flames deal no damage on their own, but as long as the flames burn, the creature can't be concealed (invisible creatures are concealed rather than being undetected) and gains weakness 15 to fire for 1 round.
Failure As success, but the effect is permanent until removed.
Critical Failure As failure, but the creature gains weakness 20 to fire.
