	(AA)
	The slaver makes two Strikes, one with its spiked whip and one unarmed attack, each using your current multiple attack penalty.

If the first strike connects, the slaver may automatically pull the target closer to him before making the second attack against the same target.
	Bleed for me, slave
	(A)
	Requirements The slaver’s last action was Double Slice, and both attacks hit the target Effect The slavers flenses the target, making it bleed and creating a weak spot. The target takes 2d8 persistent bleed damage, becomes flat-footed, and its resistances to any physical damage types are reduced by 5; these two effects last until the beginning of the slaver’s next turn.
