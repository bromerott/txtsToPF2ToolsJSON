	Bone Prison
	(AA)
	The Bone Golem throws some of its bones at a creature within 30 feet. The bones magically duplicate and form a cage surrounding the creature and trapping it. The cage has AC 5, Hardness 15, and 70 Hit Points. It's immune to critical hits and precision damage. Disintegrate destroys the sphere instantly. If the target is unwilling, the effects of the cage depend on the target's Reflex save.
Critical Success The target breaks enough bones, causing the cage to collapse entirely.
Success The cage functions normally but has only 20 Hit Points instead of 70.
Failure The cage has its normal effect.
