The DC to Administer First Aid to a creature with an infernal wound increases by 10. A spellcaster or item using healing magic on an infernally wounded creature must succeed at a DC 34 counteract check or the magic fails to heal the creature.
	Stunning Chain
	(incapacitation) If the cornugon critically hits with its spiked chain Strike, the target must succeed at a DC 34 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1 round (1d4 rounds on a critical failure).
