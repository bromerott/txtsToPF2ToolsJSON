	Infernal Temptation
	Diabolic study has garnered the attention of at least one devil that is actively trying to possess the priest. When the priest publicly espouses the benefits of diabolic power (whether they believe it a good thing or not), they gain a +1 status bonus to skill checks, AC, and saves for 1 day. These bonuses don't apply against devils. At the end of the day, the priest must attempt a DC 20 Will save, becoming possessed for 1 day on a failure (permanently on a critical failure).
