	Indomitable Oration Any creature capable of comprehending speech understands Fangrane, as if they constantly spoke in all languages at once.
	Whispers of Discord (R) Trigger A creature within 60 feet is targeted by a spell that would restore Hit Points or provide a status bonus (Fangrane automatically recognizes such effects); Effect Fangrane whispers disturbing lies, audible only to the target, to shake the target's faith in the spell's caster. The target must attempt a DC 45 Will save.


Critical Success The target disbelieves the lies and receives the intended benefit of the spell; the target becomes temporarily immune to Whispers of Discord for 24 hours.
Success As critical success, but the target isn't temporarily immune.
Failure The spell fails to affect the target. The target refuses all aid from that caster for 1 round and doesn't count as the caster's ally.
Critical Failure As failure, but the duration is 1 minute.

	Boundless Reach
	(conjuration, divine, teleportation) Fangrane’s razor-sharp claws can slice through reality, allowing them to make claw Strikes and use spells with a range of touch against any creature they can see directly or via divination magic. A creature targeted this way can retaliate until the start of Fangrane’s next turn; it can target the devil's claws as if the devil were physically present and adjacent to the target, though the claws are concealed.
