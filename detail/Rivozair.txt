	Draconic Frenzy

	DC 35; 6th spirit blast, vampiric exsanguination; true seeing (at will); 1st create water (at will; see desert thirst); Cantrips (6th) divine lance
	

	Desert Thirst
	When casting create water, Rivozair can attempt to destroy liquid instead of creating it, turning an equal amount of liquid into sand. This destroys liquid magic or alchemical items if they're of a lower level than him (a creature can attempt a DC 34 Will save to protect all liquids in its possession). This doesn't affect the liquids in a creature's body.
	

	Draconic Momentum
	Rivozair recharges its Breath Weapon whenever it scores a critical hit with a Strike.
