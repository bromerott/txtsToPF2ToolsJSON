	Furious Fusilade
	(AAA)
	The erinys hovers in place if they are flying and fires one arrow at any number of creatures in a 30-foot cone. Each attack is rolled separately. This counts as one attack for the purpose of the erinyes multiple attack penalty.
	Divine Innate Spells DC 28; 5th dimension door; 4th dimension door (at will), divine wrath, retributive pain; 3rd fear (at will); 2nd illusory disguise (at will), illusory object; Constant (6th) true seeing Rituals DC 26; 1st infernal pact
	Flames of Fury Any weapon an erinys holds gains the effects of a flaming rune while they hold it.
	Rope Snare
	An erinys carries a coil of rope woven of their hair (use the statistics for rope) that animates in their hands. When a creature is hit by the erinys’s rope, a segment of the rope tears loose and wraps itself around the creature, imposing a 10–foot circumstance penalty to Speed. The piece that tears off is 10 feet long for a Medium or smaller creature, and doubles in length for each size larger than Medium. When a creature Escapes the effect (DC 28), the detached segment of rope withers away into useless black sludge.
