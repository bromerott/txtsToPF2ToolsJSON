	Magic Drain
	The bite of a nightwing drains magical power and energy. When a nightwing bites a foe, the victim must make a DC 36 Will save or one spell effect currently affecting him immediately ends—determine which spell is drained randomly if the target is under the effects of more than one spell. The nightwing heals damage equal to twice the level of the spell drained—hit points in excess of its maximum are instead gained as temporary hit points that last for 1 hour.
