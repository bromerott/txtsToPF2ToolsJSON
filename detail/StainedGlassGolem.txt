	Spell Reflection (R)  (abjuration, arcane) Trigger The glass golem is targeted by a spell; Effect The glass golem positions its magical, reflective surfaces to turn the spell back on the caster. It tries to counteract the spell by attempting an Acrobatics check for its counteract check. If it successfully counteracts the spell, the effect is turned back on the caster.

	Dazzling Brilliance
	(AA)
	(evocation, light, visual) The glass golem creates waves of scintillating luminosity that cast bright light in a 60-foot emanation (and dim light for the next 60 feet). The light lasts until the start of the glass golem's next turn, after which the glass golem can't use Dazzling Brilliance for 1d4 rounds. A creature within the bright light or that enters the bright light must attempt a DC 27 Will save.
* Success The creature is unaffected.
* Failure The creature is dazzled for 1 round.
* Critical Failure The creature is blinded for 1 round and then dazzled for an additional 4 rounds.
