	Hail of Blades
	(AA)
	Bejakra spins in place and throws phantom daggers around her, as a 40-foot emanation. All creatures in the area except her take 8d10 piercing damage and must make a DC 38 Reflex save.

Critical Success The creature is unaffected.
Success The creature takes full damage.
Failure The creature takes full damage and is drained 1d4.
Critical Failure The creature takes double damage and is drained 4.

The hail of blades continues for 1 round, and any creature that comes within the area during that time must attempt a save against the effect. A creature can’t be affected more than once by the same Hail. Bejakra can’t Hail again for 1d4 rounds.
	Terrifying Assassin
	A creature damaged by Balgorrah that isn’t already frightened must attempt a DC 38 Will save (DC 43 if the attack was a critical hit). If the creature fails its save, it’s frightened 2; on a critical failure, the creature also cowers with fear and is stunned 4. If the creature is protected against fear by a spell or magic item, Balgorrah first attempts to counteract the protection effect, with the effect of a 9th-level dispel magic spell.
	Step of Shadow
	When Bejakra Strides at least 10 feet, she is concealed by shadows until the start of their next turn. Creatures with greater darkvision can ignore this concealment.
	Sneak Attack
	Bejakra deals an additional 3d6 points of precision damage against flat-footed and frightened creatures.
