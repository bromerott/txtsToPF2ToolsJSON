	(AA)
	(auditory, divine, emotion, enchantment, fear, mental) The wretch ghost laments its fate, forcing each living creature within 30 feet to attempt a DC 23 Will save. On a failure, a creature becomes frightened 2 (or frightened 3 on a critical failure). On a success, a creature is temporarily immune to this ghostâ€™s frightful moan for 1 minute.
