	Shadow cloak 
	(A)
	(divine, illusion, shadow) The shadow giant becomes shrouded in shadows and becomes concealed. As the nature of this effect leaves the giant's location obvious, it can't use this concealment to Hide or Sneak. This effect lasts for 1 minute or until it is exposed to direct sunlight, whichever comes first.
	Throw Rock
	(A)
	

	Pall of Shadow
	(divine, necromancy, shadow) When a shadow giant hits with a melee Strike, the target must succeed at a DC 32 Fortitude save or become drained 1 and take a â€“1 status penalty to Perception checks involving sight as long as they remain drained. On a critical failure, this condition doesn't heal naturally and can be removed only with magic.
