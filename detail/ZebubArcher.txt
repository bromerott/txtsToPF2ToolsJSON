	The zebub records everything they see, and though they don't remember all observations, they can pass them along to another creature. The zebub replays 10 minutes of witnessed events to a touched willing creature, which receives the memories in a flash of information. By remaining in contact, the zebub can spend additional 3-action activities to replay more information. After relaying their visions to another, the zebub can't ever recall those events again.
	Sneak Attack
	The zebub's Strikes deal an additional 2d6 precision damage to flat-footed creatures. Additionally, frightened creatures are flat-footed to the Zebub Archer.
