	Devil Shaping
	(divine, downtime, transmutation) The pit fiend reshapes a large number of lemures within a 600-foot radius into more powerful devils to swell Hell’s legions. The pit fiend must have available the number of lemures listed on the table in the sidebar. The pit fiend can shape 100 lemures per day, to a maximum of 1,100 lemures in 11 days. Devils created in this way are in thrall to the pit fiend and follow its orders, with the exception of created pit fiends or other devils of similar power, which are always independent. As a result, few pit fiends choose to create peers. At the end of the Devil Shaping activity, the pit fiend attempts an incredibly hard Religion check of the desired devil’s level, with results as follows.
Critical Success The pit fiend shapes two devils from the massed lemures instead of one.
Success The pit fiend shapes a devil of the desired type and level.
Failure The devil shaped from the lemures is 2 levels lower than the intended devil.
Critical Failure The pit fiend fails to shape any devils and draws the ire of an archdevil for its waste of resources.
