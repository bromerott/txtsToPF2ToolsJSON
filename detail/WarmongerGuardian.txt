	Hellstrider The guardian ignores the effects of non-magical difficult terrain. They take no damage from caltrops or from damaging terrain that deals physical, acid, or cold damage. The guardian can move through liquids up to 5 feet deep at their full Speed.
	Phalanx Fighter All devils of equal or lower level adjacent to the guardian gain a +2 circumstance bonus to their AC as the levaloch shields them from harm.

	Barbed Net
	When the guardian hits a creature with their barbed net, the net wraps around the target, which becomes clumsy 3 and takes a –20-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds. If the Strike was a critical success, the target is also immobilized. When a creature Escapes (DC 40), or if the Strike misses, the net crumbles into rust. Each time a creature attempts to Escape, it takes 3d6 slashing damage from the net's barbs, regardless of whether the attempt succeeds.
	Forge Weapon
	(A)
	(manipulate) The  guardian reforges part of their barbed iron substance into a new +3 greater striking trident or barbed net. Their previous trident crumbles to rust. When the guardian
is destroyed, any tridents or barbed nets they created crumble to rust.
	Infernal Determination
	(A)
	Frequency: Once per day
Effect: The guardian shrugs off their enemies’ spells and conditions when the need is dire. They choose a single nonpermanent spell or condition affecting them. If the levaloch chooses a condition, its effect on them ends. If it chooses a spell, it can attempt to counteract the spell by making a Will save as the counteract check. The counteract level is 8
	Merciless Thrust
	When a guardian hits a creature that has the clumsy, enfeebled, immobilized, or restrained conditions with a melee trident Strike, the Strike deals an additional 4d6 damage.
