	Frequency Once per day. Requirements The gardener hasn’t acted yet on this turn. Effect The gardener expends the power stored in its signet ring. This gives her the ability to cast one prepared spell it had already previously cast today, without spending a spell slot. The gardener must still Cast the Spell and meet the spell’s other requirements.
	Reach Spell
	(A)
	If the next action the gardener uses is to Cast a Spell that has a range, increase that spell's range by 30 feet. As is standard for increasing spell ranges, if the spell normally has a range of touch, extend its range to 30 feet.
