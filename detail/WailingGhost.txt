	Wail of Despair
	(AA)
	(auditory, divine, emotion, enchantment, fear, mental) The ghost screams in despair, accusing those nearby of being guilty of their death, forcing each living creature within 30 feet to attempt a Will save DC 21. On a failure, a creature becomes frightened 2 (or frightened 3 on a critical failure). On a success, a creature is temporarily immune to this wailing ghostâ€™s frightful moan for 1 minute.
