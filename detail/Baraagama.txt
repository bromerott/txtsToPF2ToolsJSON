	Naturally Invisible The invisible stalker is invisible at all times, though when it takes a hostile action of any kind, it is hidden instead of undetected until the start of its next turn, as the vague outline of its humanoid form is faintly visible for a short period of time.

	bite +32 [+27/+22] (magical, reach 15 feet), Damage 4d12+17 piercing

	Legendary Storm
	(AAA)
	Frequency: Once per day
Baraagama can call forth a legendary storm, casting Cataclysm. However, it manifests only Incredible lightning, Beating winds and a tsunami (only 3 of the 7 effects).
	Pull Apart
	(AA)
	Baraagama makes two claw Strikes against the same target. If both hit, the target takes an extra 2d12+13 slashing damage, with a DC 36 basic Fortitude save. On a critical failure, the creature is torn to pieces and dies. Baragaama’s multiple attack penalty increases only after all the attacks are made.
	Thrash
	(AA)
	Baraagama Strikes once against each creature in its reach with its claws. Each attack takes a –2 circumstance penalty and counts toward the mukradi's multiple attack penalty, but the multiple attack penalty doesn’t increase until after all the attacks are made.
