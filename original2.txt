	HP
	280 (negative healing); Immunities death effects, disease, paralyzed, poison, precision, unconscious; Resistances all 20 (except force, ghost touch, or positive; double resistance vs. non-magical)
	Frightful Presence (aura, emotion, fear, mental) 90 feet, DC 35
	Positive Energy Transfer Reaction (divine, conjuration) Trigger Adrakash succeeds at a saving throw to resist positive damage, but still takes damage from that effect; Effect Adrakash transfers all positive damage from the effect to a single undead creature of its choice that it controls within 120 feet.
	Speed
	50 feet, fly 80 feet
	Melee
	(A)
	spectral jaws +35 [+30/+35] (reach 20 feet), Damage 8d8+8 negative plus drain life
	Melee
	(A)
	spectral claw +35 [+31/+27] (agile, reach 15 feet), Damage 8d6+8 negative plus divine dispelling and drain life
	Breath Weapon
	(AA)
	 (divine, necromancy, negative) Adrakash unleashes a burst of negative energy that deals 20d6 negative damage to all creatures in a 60-foot cone (DC 40 basic Reflex save). It can’t use Breath Weapon again for 1d4 rounds.
	Divine Dispelling
	(abjuration, divine) Adrakash’s claws rend divine magic. Whenever he hits a creature with one of its spectral claws, Adrakash can attempt a Religion check to counteract an ongoing divine spell effect (of spell level 8th or lower) on the creature.
	Draconic Frenzy
	(A)
	Adrakash makes two claw Strikes and one jaws Strike in any order.
	Phase Lurch
	(A)
	(divine, move) Requirements Adrakash is in ectoplasmic form; Effect As the Stride action, but Adrakash can pass through walls or material obstacles as though he were incorporeal. He must begin and end its movement outside of any physical obstacles, and passing through solid material is difficult terrain.
	Ectoplasmic Form
	(A)
	(divine, necromancy) Adrakash can push through the ectoplasmic veil to temporarily assume a physical form made of ectoplasm. Adrakash loses the incorporeal trait for 1d4 rounds, though it can return to its incorporeal form as a free action before then. Once this ability ends, Adrakash can’t use this ability again for 1d4 rounds. While in ectoplasmic form, Adrakash’s AC increases to 43 and it gains 100 temporary Hit Points. He loses his immunity to non-magical attacks and precision damage, as well as its resistance to all damage. His claw and jaws Strikes deal slashing and piercing damage, respectively, instead of negative damage.
	Divine Innate Spells
	DC 37, attack +35; 8th charm (undead targets only); 7th divine wrath (x3), finger of death; 6th vampiric exsanguination; 4th charm (x3; undead targets only), darkness; 3rd bind undead (at will)
	Drain Life
	(divine, necromancy) When Adrakash deals damage to a living creature with a spectral jaws or spectral claw Strike, Adrakash gains 18 temporary Hit Points, and the creature must succeed at a DC 40 Fortitude save or become drained 2. Further damage dealt by Adrakash’s spectral jaws or spectral claws Strikes increases the value of the drained condition by 2 on a failed save, to a maximum of drained 8.

	 (divine, necromancy) When Drinking Blood, Aluceda regains 10 HP.

	Diabolic study has garnered the attention of at least one devil that is actively trying to possess the priest.

These bonuses don't apply against devils. At the end of the day, the priest must attempt a DC 20 Will save, becoming possessed for 1 day on a failure (permanently on a critical failure).

	(curse, divine, enchantment, incapacitation, mental) When the specter damages a living creature with its vile touch Strike, the specter gains 5 temporary Hit Points and the target creature must attempt a DC 27 Will save to avoid becoming corrupted.
* Critical Success The creature is unaffected and is temporarily immune to spectral corruption for 1 minute.
* Success The creature is stupefied 2 for 1 hour.
* Failure The creature succumbs to the corruption and becomes a spectral thrall. The creature is controlled by the specter, obeying the specter's telepathic or spoken orders, though a spectral thrall does not obey obviously self-destructive orders. It can attempt a new Will save at the end of each of its turns; on a success, it is no longer controlled by the specter but becomes stupefied 2 for 1 hour.
* Critical Failure As failure, but the creature remains a thrall to the specter until the curse is removed or until the specter succumbs to pain starvation; it can't attempt new Will saves to recover on its own.

When Asmoden battles, an aura of negative energy surrounds him.This obscures vision, making any creature in the area concealed, and causes creatures in its area (except Asmoden) to treat all creatures as concealed. Any creature other than Asmoden that enters or begins its turn in the aura takes 2d12 negative damage.

The dying creature can attempt a DC 38 Fortitude save; if it succeeds, it doesn’t die and its soul is not trapped but it’s enervated 2 (or is unaffected entirely on a critical success). When the soul of a creature gets trapped, the creature’s body swiftly turns to dust.

	(divine, emotion, enchantment, fear, mental) Trigger The hamatula hits a creature with a barb Strike; Effect The creature struck must succeed at a DC 27 Will save or become frightened 2 (or frightened 3 on a critical failure). Regardless of the result of its saving throw, the creature is then temporarily immune to Frightful Strike for 24 hours.
	Impaling Barb
	(AA)
	The hamatula makes a barb Strike, then Strides up to half its Speed without triggering reactions. If the Strike hits, the hamatula impales the target with one of its barbs and snaps the barb free as it moves away from the target. This deals an additional 2d8 piercing damage to the target and pins it to an adjacent surface, rendering it immobilized (Escape DC 29).
	Warden of Erebus
	A hamatula's glyph of warding innate spell can contain any common spell from the Core Rulebook that meets the criteria in glyph of warding; the hamatula doesn't need to provide the spell.

	Inhabit Object
	(A)
	(necromancy, occult, possession) The dybbuk possesses a Large or smaller unattended object within 20 feet, making it an animated object. This animated object's level can be no higher than the dybbuk's level – 2. This possession ends when the object is destroyed or the dybbuk leaves it by using this ability again. At this point, the dybbuk reappears in the object's square and can't Inhabit an Object again for 1d4 rounds. If the object is destroyed, the dybbuk takes 5d6 force damage.
	Malevolent Possession
	(AA)
	(incapacitation, mental, necromancy, occult, possession) The dybbuk attempts to possess an adjacent corporeal creature. This has the same effect as the possession spell (DC 34) with an unlimited duration, except since the dybbuk doesn't have a physical body, they aren't unconscious, and aren't paralyzed when the effect ends, though they take 5d6 force damage if the body is knocked unconscious or killed. If the dybbuk took control of the target with Malevolent Possession, when the dybbuk departs, the target has only incoherent memories of the interval it was possessed. If a creature dies while possessed by the dybbuk and its corpse remains intact, the dybbuk can immediately inhabit the corpse (see Inhabit Object) as a reaction, in which case the corpse becomes an animated object.

Further damage dealt by the wraith increases the drained condition value by 1 on a failed save, to a maximum of drained 4.
	Wraith Spawn
	(divine, necromancy) A living humanoid slain by a herecite’s spectral hand Strike rises as a wraith spawn after 1d4 rounds. This wraith spawn is under the command of the herecite that killed it. It doesn't have drain life or wraith spawn. If the creator of the wraith spawn dies, the wraith spawn becomes a full-fledged, autonomous wraith; it regains its free will and gains drain life and wraith spawn.

The cage has AC 5, Hardness 15, and 70 Hit Points. It's immune to critical hits and precision damage. Disintegrate destroys the sphere instantly. If the target is unwilling, the effects of the cage depend on the target's Reflex save.
Critical Success The target breaks enough bones, causing the cage to collapse entirely.
Success The cage functions normally but has only 20 Hit Points instead of 70.
Failure The cage has its normal effect.

	Ward Contract

	horn +29 [+24/+19] (magical), Damage 4d10+15 piercing and infernal wound
	Draft Contract
	(AAA)
	(conjuration, divine, manipulate) The contract devil produces an infernal contract for a single living mortal. This contract can grant a wide range of abilities and effects, akin to the power of a wish spell but fulfilled to the letter by the contract devil. To receive any of those benefits, the mortal must willingly sign its true name to the contract. At that point, the mortal’s soul is bound to the contract devil and Hell.
While the contract is in effect, the victim can’t be restored to life except by wish or similar magic. If the mortal is restored to life by those means, the contract devil knows which mortal came to life and can locate the creature or creatures who restored the mortal to life for 1 year, gaining the effects of a locate spell with unlimited range. Avoiding the terms of an infernal contract is difficult and often dangerous.
	Infernal Investment
	A contract devil can cast a 10th-level innate scrying spell at will, but only to target a creature with which it has a contract. The target automatically critically fails its save.
	Infernal Wound
	(divine, necromancy) A contract devil’s Strikes also deal 3d6 persistent bleed damage that resist attempts to heal it. The flat check to stop the bleeding starts at DC 20. The DC is reduced to 15 only if the bleeding creature or an ally successfully assists with the recovery. The DC to Administer First Aid to a creature with an infernal wound is increased by 5.

	Devil Shaping
	(divine, downtime, transmutation) The pit fiend reshapes a large number of lemures within a 600-foot radius into more powerful devils to swell Hell’s legions. The pit fiend must have available the number of lemures listed on the table in the sidebar. The pit fiend can shape 100 lemures per day, to a maximum of 1,100 lemures in 11 days. Devils created in this way are in thrall to the pit fiend and follow its orders, with the exception of created pit fiends or other devils of similar power, which are always independent. As a result, few pit fiends choose to create peers. At the end of the Devil Shaping activity, the pit fiend attempts an incredibly hard Religion check of the desired devil’s level, with results as follows.
Critical Success The pit fiend shapes two devils from the massed lemures instead of one.
Success The pit fiend shapes a devil of the desired type and level.
Failure The devil shaped from the lemures is 2 levels lower than the intended devil.
Critical Failure The pit fiend fails to shape any devils and draws the ire of an archdevil for its waste of resources.

	(divine, necromancy) Requirement The shadow hit a living creature with a shadow hand Strike on its previous action. Effect The shadow pulls at the target’s shadow, making the creature enfeebled 1. This is cumulative with other enfeebled conditions from shadows, to a maximum of enfeebled 4. If this increases a creature’s enfeebled value to 3 or more, the target’s shadow is separated from its body (see shadow spawn). Enfeebled from Steal Shadow decreases by 1 every hour.
	Slink in Shadow
	The greater shadow can Hide or end its Sneak in a creature’s or object’s shadow.
	Shadow Spawn
	When a creature’s shadow is pulled free by Steal Shadow, it becomes a shadow spawn under the command of the greater shadow that created it. This shadow spawn doesn’t have Steal Shadow. If the creature the shadow spawn was pulled from dies, the shadow spawn becomes a full-fledged, autonomous shadow. If the creature recovers from its enfeeblement, its shadow returns to it and the shadow spawn is extinguished.

	Frequency Once per day. Requirements Zella hasn’t acted yet on this turn. Effect Zella expends the power stored in its signet ring. This gives her the ability to cast one prepared spell it had already previously cast today, without spending a spell slot. Zella must still Cast the Spell and meet the spell’s other requirements.
	Reach Spell
	(A)
	If the next action Zella uses is to Cast a Spell that has a range, increase that spell's range by 30 feet. As is standard for increasing spell ranges, if the spell normally has a range of touch, extend its range to 30 feet.

	The zebub records everything they see, and though they don't remember all observations, they can pass them along to another creature. The zebub replays 10 minutes of witnessed events to a touched willing creature, which receives the memories in a flash of information. By remaining in contact, the zebub can spend additional 3-action activities to replay more information. After relaying their visions to another, the zebub can't ever recall those events again.
	Sneak Attack
