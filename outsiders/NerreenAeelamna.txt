	Hunt Prey
	(A)
	Nerreen designates a single creature he can see and hear as their prey. He gains a +2 circumstance bonus to Perception check to Seek the prey and to Survival checks to Track the prey. The first time he hits the designated prey in a round, he deals an additional 1d8 precision damage. He also ignores the penalty for making ranged attacks within their second range increment. These effects last until he uses Hunt Prey again
