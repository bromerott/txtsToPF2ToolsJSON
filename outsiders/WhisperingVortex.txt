	Description
	A vortex of whispering decapitated heads begins whirling and churling, creating a sickly green vortex of ghostly energy.
	Disable Religion DC 36 (master) to ritually exorcise the ghosts forming the vortex,, as well as Diplomacy DC 34 (master) or Perform DC 36 (master) to give words of encouragement strong enough to overpower the haunt’s whispers. Three successful checks are needed to reduce the vortex’s size enough for it to disappear completely.
	Vortex of Despair (R)  Trigger  A target within 30 feet of the vortex notices it; Effect The heads swirling inside the vortex start screaming for help, cursing uncontrollably, and worse, making anyone who hears them crazy. The vortex casts an 8th-level Confusion spell (Will save DC 32).
	Routine
	(AAA)
	The vortex grows in size, as the heads inside harmonize their screams - the resulting sound evokes thoughts of the worst fears of  any living creature within 120 feet of it, as per the Weird spell (Will save DC 33). For each successful check at disabling the haunt, increase the DC by 2.
	Reset
	The trap ends when the trap is unable to target any living creatures in its range. It then resets instantly.
